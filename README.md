# Technical Session with Morgan

Making use of the Firebase Tools, write a basic web based application, that allows you to do the following:
- Allows a user to authenticate with an email and password and stores the data in firebase realtime database.
- Allows the user to sign in and signout.
- Allows the user to send a limited 140 character message
- Alerts an existing user every time a new user posts a new limited message
